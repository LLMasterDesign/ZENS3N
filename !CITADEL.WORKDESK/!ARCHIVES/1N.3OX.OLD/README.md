## 🎯 What is 3OX.Ai?

3OX.Ai is an **intelligent orchestration framework** that solves the multi-agent chaos problem. It provides structure, safety, and scalability for AI workflows—preventing context explosions, recursive loops, and configuration drift.

Think of it as the **operating system for your AI agents**.

### The Problem

```
❌ Traditional Single-Agent Hell:
- Agent does EVERYTHING
- Context explodes
- Recursive loops form
- System collapses
```

### The 3OX Solution

```
✅ Focused Multi-Agent Orchestration:
- Separate agents for separate concerns
- Hierarchical access control
- Byzantine fault tolerance
- No recursive loops
- Infinite scalability
```

---

## ⚡ Quick Start

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g 3ox-ai

# Create a new project
npx create-3ox-ai my-project

# Or initialize in existing directory
cd my-project
3ox init
```

That's it! You now have:
- ✅ Structured `.3ox/` brain folder
- ✅ Agent instructions ready
- ✅ Protection rules configured
- ✅ Git integration set up

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

3OX.Ai is built on three core layers:

### 1. **POLICY** — Supreme Laws
- Sirius time format (⧗-YY.DD)
- Access control hierarchy
- Protection rules
- Multi-agent resource management

### 2. **CORE** — System Logic
- Genesis architecture
- Routing protocols
- State tracking
- Template system

### 3. **OPS** — Operations & Security
- Byzantine fault tolerance
- Drift detection
- Monitoring tools
- Registry system

## 🎓 Core Concepts

### The Multi-Agent Pattern

Instead of one agent doing everything, 3OX separates concerns:

```
CMD.BRIDGE (Level 1)
├── Manages infrastructure
├── Configures .3ox files
└── Coordinates operations

Station Agents (Level 2)
├── Read configuration
├── Execute operations
└── Report status

Worker Agents (Level 3)
├── Focus on tasks
├── No infrastructure changes
└── Maximum productivity
```

**Result:** No context collapse. No recursive loops. Pure efficiency.

### Access Hierarchy

- **Level 0: Commander** — You (full control)
- **Level 1: CMD.BRIDGE** — Infrastructure management
- **Level 2: Station OPS** — Operational coordination
- **Level 3: Workers** — Task execution

Each level has clear boundaries and responsibilities.

## 🔧 CLI Commands

```bash
3ox init              # Initialize in current directory
3ox create <name>     # Create new project
3ox validate          # Validate configuration
3ox help              # Show help
```

## 🌟 Why 3OX?

> **"The workers build the product. The command builds the workers. This is not restriction—this is liberation. Each agent, free to focus on what it does best."**

3OX.Ai emerged from real-world multi-agent chaos. It's battle-tested on the Atlas.Legacy system—a complex multi-station, multi-project, multi-agent operation that would have been impossible without this structure.

Now it's available for everyone.
