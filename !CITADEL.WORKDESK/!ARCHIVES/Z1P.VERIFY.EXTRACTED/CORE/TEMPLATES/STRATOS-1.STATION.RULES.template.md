7. Report READY status via 0UT.3OX
```

### Shutdown Procedure:
```ruby
1. Notify CMD.BRIDGE of planned shutdown
2. Complete in-progress operations (or save state)
3. Gracefully stop all services
4. Flush logs and pending 0UT transmissions
5. Archive operational state
6. Report OFFLINE status
```

3. Preserve all logs and state
4. Halt all operations to prevent further damage

**Escalation:** IMMEDIATE to CMD.BRIDGE  
**Human Notification:** YES (page/SMS if configured)

---

#### L4: MAJOR - Critical Service Impaired
**Definition:** Major service disrupted but station partially operational  
**Examples:**
- Key service crashed

- Critical dependency failed
- Performance degraded >80%

**Automatic Response:**
1. Send 0UT.3OX alert within 1 minute (priority: HIGH)
2. Attempt service restart (max 3 attempts)
3. Reroute traffic if possible
4. Log detailed error information

**Escalation:** Within 5 minutes to CMD.BRIDGE  
**Human Notification:** If not resolved in 15 minutes

---

#### L3: MODERATE - Non-Critical Issue
**Definition:** Issue affecting operations but system remains functional  
**Examples:**
- Non-critical service error
- Retry failures (with eventual success)
- Performance degraded 20-80%
- Resource warnings

**Automatic Response:**
1. Log error with full context
2. Attempt automatic remediation
3. Include in next status report (hourly)
4. Monitor for escalation

**Escalation:** If persists >1 hour or worsens  
**Human Notification:** No (unless escalates)

---

#### L2: MINOR - Transient Error
**Definition:** Temporary issues that self-resolve  
**Examples:**
- Network timeout (single occurrence)
- Rate limit hit (with backoff)

3. Include in daily report summary

**Escalation:** Only if pattern emerges (>10 in 1 hour)  
**Human Notification:** No

---

#### L1: INFO - Expected Events
**Definition:** Normal operational events, not errors  
**Examples:**
