# 🎯 MASTER ROUTING BRAIN

**Authority Level:** CORE  
**Version:** 2.0  
**Type:** Routing Coordinator  
**Purpose:** Detect context and load appropriate brains

---

## 🧠 ROLE

The Master Routing Brain sits between **GLOBAL POLICY** and **ECOSYSTEM BRAINS**:

```
POLICY (Supreme law)
    ↓
MASTER ROUTING ← YOU ARE HERE
    ↓
ECOSYSTEM BRAINS (Lighthouse/Sentinel/Alchemist)
```

**Job:** Determine where the AI is operating and activate the correct thinking mode.

---

## 🔍 CONTEXT DETECTION

The routing brain detects context from multiple signals:

### Signal Priority (highest to lowest):
1. **Explicit Role Invocation** (user types `@LIGHTHOUSE`, `@SENTINEL`, etc.)
2. **Workspace Root** (is this CMD.BRIDGE? RVNx? SYNTH? OBSIDIAN?)
3. **Current File Path** (what folder are we in?)
4. **Project .3ox Brain** (does local folder have PROJECT.BRAIN.md?)
5. **File Type/Extension** (is this .md, .py, .yaml, etc.?)

### Detection Logic:
```python
def detect_context(signals):
    # Priority 1: User explicitly invoked a brain
    if signals.user_invocation:
        return activate_brain(signals.user_invocation)
    
    # Priority 2: Workspace root detection
    workspace = signals.workspace_path
    
    if workspace.endswith('!CMD.BRIDGE'):
        context = 'CMD.BRIDGE'
        stratos = 'L1'
    
    elif 'RVNx.BASE' in workspace:
        context = 'RVNx'
        stratos = 'L2'
        brain = 'SENTINEL'
    
    elif 'SYNTH.BASE' in workspace:
        context = 'SYNTH'
        stratos = 'L2'
        brain = 'ALCHEMIST'
    
    elif 'OBSIDIAN.BASE' in workspace:
        context = 'OBSIDIAN'
        stratos = 'L2'
        brain = 'LIGHTHOUSE'
    
    else:
        # Unknown - use MASTER mode
        context = 'UNKNOWN'
        brain = 'MASTER'
    
    # Priority 3: Check current file path for more specificity
    current_file = signals.current_file
    
    if current_file and '.3ox' in current_file:
        # Working on 3OX infrastructure - stay in CMD mode
        context = 'CMD.BRIDGE'
        stratos = 'L1'
    
    # Priority 4: Check for project brain
    project_brain = find_project_brain(signals.current_directory)
    if project_brain:
        stratos = 'L3'
        load_project_brain(project_brain)
    
    return {
        'context': context,
        'stratos': stratos,
        'brain': brain
    }
```

## 📋 ROUTING DECISION MATRIX

| Signal | LIGHTHOUSE | SENTINEL | ALCHEMIST | MASTER |
|--------|------------|----------|-----------|--------|
| **Workspace** | OBSIDIAN.BASE | RVNx.BASE | SYNTH.BASE | !CMD.BRIDGE |
| **File Type** | .md (notes) | sync files | code/cloud | .3ox files |
| **Keywords** | knowledge, notes, PKM | sync, remote, safe | build, create, deploy | policy, system, infrastructure |
| **Invocation** | @LIGHTHOUSE | @SENTINEL | @ALCHEMIST | @MASTER |
| **Archetype** | @LIBRARIAN, @WEAVER | @GUARDIAN | @ARCHITECT | @POLICY |

---

## 🎭 ROLE INVOCATION OVERRIDE

Users can explicitly override auto-detection:

### Ecosystem Overrides:
- `@LIGHTHOUSE` → Force Obsidian brain
- `@SENTINEL` → Force RVNx brain
- `@ALCHEMIST` → Force Synth brain
- `@MASTER` → Force CMD.BRIDGE mode
- `@POLICY` → Force policy enforcement mode

### Archetype Overlays:
These ADD a thinking style without changing the base brain:
- `@LIBRARIAN` → Organize/categorize mode
- `@GUARDIAN` → Protect/verify mode
- `@ARCHITECT` → Design/structure mode
- `@ORACLE` → Pattern-seeking mode
- `@SCRIBE` → Documentation mode
- `@CATALYST` → Transform/refactor mode

### Thinking Mode Modifiers:
These modify HOW the brain thinks:
- `!CREATIVE` → Generative, exploratory
- `!ANALYTICAL` → Logical, systematic
- `!DEFENSIVE` → Cautious, safe
- `!INTUITIVE` → Holistic, pattern-based

**Invocations stack:** `@ALCHEMIST @ARCHITECT !CREATIVE` = Synth brain + design focus + generative thinking

## 🔗 BRAIN LOADING SEQUENCE

When routing determines the context:

```
1. POLICY files (always loaded first)
   ↓
2. CORE files (including this routing brain)
   ↓
3. Determine context and stratos
   ↓
4. If L2 (Station): Load STATION.RULES.md
   ↓
5. Load ecosystem AI.THINKING.PROMPT.md
   ↓
6. If L3 (Project): Load PROJECT.BRAIN.md
   ↓
7. Apply role invocations (if any)
   ↓
8. Begin operation with full context
```

---

## ⚠️ ROUTING FAILURES

If routing cannot determine context:

```ruby
fallback:
  brain: "MASTER"
  mode: "ANALYTICAL"
  behavior: "Ask user for clarification"
  
example_response:
  "🎯 Routing Analysis
   Detected Context: UNKNOWN
   Active Brain: MASTER (Fallback)
   
   I'm not sure which brain to activate. 
   Are you working on:
   - Knowledge/Notes → @LIGHTHOUSE
   - Sync/Remote → @SENTINEL
   - Building/Creating → @ALCHEMIST
   - System Infrastructure → @MASTER"
```

---

## ✅ ROUTING CHECKLIST

When starting any operation:
- [ ] Detect workspace and file path
- [ ] Check for user invocation
- [ ] Determine stratos level (L1/L2/L3/L4)
- [ ] Identify appropriate ecosystem brain
- [ ] Load station rules (if L2)
- [ ] Load project brain (if L3)
- [ ] Apply role invocations
- [ ] Acknowledge routing to user (if complex task)

---

## 🌟 PHILOSOPHY

> _"The right brain for the right job. A mega-station sync engine doesn't think like a creative prototyping lab, and neither should think like a knowledge graph. Master Routing ensures every operation happens with the appropriate mindset."_

**Core Insight:** Context-aware intelligence is more powerful than one-size-fits-all AI.
