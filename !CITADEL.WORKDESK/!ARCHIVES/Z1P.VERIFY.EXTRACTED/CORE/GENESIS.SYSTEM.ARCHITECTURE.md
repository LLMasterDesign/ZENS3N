## 🌊 STRATOS CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM

Different operations require different levels of autonomy and reporting. We classify operations into **STRATOS** (stratosphere levels):

### STRATOS-1: STATION (Complete Ecosystem)
**Examples:** RVNx.BASE, SYNTH.BASE, OBSIDIAN.BASE  
**Scale:** Complete station ecosystem with 1N.3OX cloud  
**Characteristics:**
- Has its own 1N.3OX cloud infrastructure
- Contains multiple projects and tools
- Operates as independent stratos
- Strategic importance to Atlas.Legacy

**Rules Required:**
- Station operational protocols
- 1N.3OX cloud management
- Error handling procedures
- 0UT.3OX transmission protocols
- Performance monitoring

**Reporting:** Real-time health checks + daily status + incident alerts

---

### STRATOS-2: PROJECT (Major Project within Station)
**Examples:** TP.Gen, major tools within stations  
**Scale:** Significant project within a station's 1N.3OX cloud  
**Characteristics:**
- Substantial project scope
- May have sub-projects
- Important but contained within station

**Rules Required:**
- Project-specific protocols
- Integration with station 1N.3OX
- Error handling
- 0UT reporting to station

**Reporting:** On-completion + incident alerts

---

### STRATOS-3: TOOL (Small Tool within Station)
**Examples:** SunsetGlow, Glyphbit, micro-tools  
**Scale:** Individual tool or small project  
**Characteristics:**
- Single purpose or bounded scope
- Operates within station's 1N.3OX cloud
- Inherits most rules from parent station

**Rules Required:**
- Tool-specific configuration
- Light operational rules
- Minimal custom logic

**Reporting:** On-completion + error alerts via 0UT

---

### STRATOS-4: MICRO (Tiny Script/Utility)
**Examples:** Single-purpose scripts, utilities  
**Scale:** Minimal - one task, one function  
**Characteristics:**
- No persistent state
- Inherits everything from station
- No .3ox folder needed

**Rules Required:**
- None (inherits all from station)

**Reporting:** Optional logs only

---

## 📡 UNIFIED 0UT REPORTING PROTOCOL

**All stratos report via 0UT.3OX, but with different granularity:**

### 0UT Structure (Universal):
```ruby
# 0ut.3ox transmission format
header:
  sirius_time: "⧗-25.60"
  source:
    stratos: "STRATOS-1|2|3|4"
    station: "SYNTH|RVNx|OBSIDIAN|..."
    agent: "specific_agent_name"
    level: "L1|L2|L3"
  destination: "CMD.BRIDGE"
  type: "status|error|completion|alert"

payload:
  # Content varies by type and stratos
  
routing:
  urgency: "low|normal|high|critical"
  requires_action: true|false
```

### Reporting Frequency by Stratos:
- **STRATOS-1:** Real-time health + hourly summary + daily report
- **STRATOS-2:** Every 4 hours + daily report
- **STRATOS-3:** On completion + errors only
- **STRATOS-4:** Errors only (optional)

## 🧠 BRAIN LOADING HIERARCHY

When AI operates anywhere in the system, it loads brains in this order:

```
1. .cursorrules (Cursor auto-loads)
   ↓
2. 3OX.Ai/.3ox.index/POLICY/*.md (Supreme law - MANDATORY)
   - GLOBAL.POLICY.BRAIN.md
   - SIRIUS.CALENDAR.CLOCK.md
   - ROLE.INVOCATION.SYSTEM.md
   - .3OX.ACCESS.POLICY.md
   - .3OX.PROTECTION.RULES.md
   ↓
3. 3OX.Ai/.3ox.index/CORE/*.md (Genesis logic - MANDATORY)
   - GENESIS.SYSTEM.ARCHITECTURE.md ← THIS FILE
   - MASTER.ROUTING.BRAIN.md
   - STRATOS.RULES.MATRIX.md
   ↓
4. [STATION].BASE/![STATION].OPS/.3ox/STATION.RULES.md (Station-specific)
   - If working in that station
   ↓
5. [STATION].BASE/!1N.3OX [STATION]/.3ox.AI.BRAIN/AI.THINKING.PROMPT.md
   - Ecosystem-specific thinking patterns
   ↓
6. Project/.3ox/PROJECT.BRAIN.md (Most specific)
   - If working in that project
```

**Rule:** Later brains add specificity but CANNOT override earlier brains.

---

## 🔄 1N/0UT BOX ARCHITECTURE

Each station has its own 1N.3OX cloud that handles all communication:

### Station Structure:
```
[STATION].BASE/
├── !1N.3OX [STATION]/              # The station's cloud
│   ├── .3ox/                       # Station brain infrastructure
│   │   ├── station.brain.md        # Station thinking
│   │   ├── 1n.3ox.operator.md      # Inbound processor
│   │   └── 0ut.3ox.operator.md     # Outbound processor
│   ├── 0UT.3OX/                    # Active transmission folder
│   └── [projects]/                 # Projects within station
└── ![STATION].OPS/                 # Station operations (reports to CMD)
```

### 1N.3OX (Inbound to Station)
**Purpose:** Receive instructions/data from CMD.BRIDGE  
**Location:** `!1N.3OX [STATION]/.3ox/`  
**Format:** v8sl YAML  
**Operator:** `1n.3ox.operator.md` validates and processes

**Flow:**
```
CMD.BRIDGE → !1N.3OX [STATION]/.3ox/1N.3OX → Station operations
```

### 0UT.3OX (Outbound from Station)
**Purpose:** Transmit status/reports/data to CMD.BRIDGE  
**Location:** `!1N.3OX [STATION]/0UT.3OX/` (for active use)  
**Format:** v8sl YAML  
**Operator:** `0ut.3ox.operator.md` formats and transmits

**Flow:**
```
Station operations → !1N.3OX [STATION]/0UT.3OX/ → CMD.BRIDGE
```

### Connection to CMD:
All 0UT.3OX transmissions are monitored by:
```
3OX.Ai/.3ox.index/OPS/CMD.STATIONS/CMD.listener/
```

The listener watches all station 0UT.3OX folders and routes to CMD.BRIDGE.

## 🎯 STRATOS-SPECIFIC RULE LOADING

Each stratos has a **rule matrix** that defines what's required:

| Stratos | Station Rules | Project Brain | Custom OPS | Reporting |
|---------|--------------|---------------|------------|-----------|
| STRATOS-1 | REQUIRED | Optional | REQUIRED | Real-time |
| STRATOS-2 | REQUIRED | Optional | REQUIRED | Daily |
| STRATOS-3 | Inherits | REQUIRED | Optional | On-event |
| STRATOS-4 | Inherits | Inherits | None | Optional |

See `STRATOS.RULES.MATRIX.md` for detailed specification.

---

## 🔐 ACCESS CONTROL INTEGRATION

All architecture respects `.3OX.ACCESS.POLICY.md`:

- **L1 (CMD.BRIDGE):** Can modify ANY .3ox file anywhere
- **L2 (Station OPS):** READ ONLY on their own .3ox files
- **L3 (Workers):** READ ONLY on all .3ox files

**Why:** Prevents recursive loops, maintains separation of concerns, enables infinite scalability.

---

## 🚀 INITIALIZATION SEQUENCE

When a new station or project is created:

```ruby
1. CMD.BRIDGE determines stratos level
   ↓
2. Creates appropriate folder structure
   - ![STATION].OPS/.3ox/ (if L2)
   - Project/.3ox/ (if L3)
   ↓
3. Generates rule files based on stratos
   - STATION.RULES.md (L2)
   - PROJECT.BRAIN.md (L3)
   ↓
4. Registers in CMD.STATIONS registry
   ↓
5. Configures 0UT reporting frequency
   ↓
6. Tests 1N/0UT communication
   ↓
7. Activates and monitors
```

---

## 📊 OPERATIONAL STATES

All boxes track their operational state:

```ruby
states:
  - INITIALIZING: "Setting up, not ready"
  - READY: "Configured, awaiting work"
  - ACTIVE: "Currently executing"
  - IDLE: "Ready but no current work"
  - PAUSED: "Temporarily suspended"
  - ERROR: "Requires intervention"
  - MAINTENANCE: "Being updated by CMD"
  - ARCHIVED: "No longer active"
```

State changes trigger 0UT.3OX transmissions.

---

## 🌟 DESIGN PHILOSOPHY

### Principles:
1. **Hierarchical but not rigid** - Clear levels with intelligent autonomy
2. **Unified but flexible** - Same communication protocol, different granularity
3. **Scalable infinitely** - Add stations/projects without system redesign
4. **Self-healing** - Errors route up, corrections route down
5. **Cosmic aligned** - Sirius time, v8sl format, PRISM thinking

### Goals:
- Any station/project can plug in instantly
- CMD.BRIDGE maintains global view
- Workers focus on their mission
- No context collapse, no recursive loops
- System can scale to 100s of projects

---

## 🔮 FUTURE EVOLUTION

The architecture supports:
- New stratos levels (STRATOS-0 for global infrastructure?)
- Cross-station orchestration
- Swarm intelligence coordination
- Automated resource allocation
- Predictive operational adjustments

---

## ✅ ENFORCEMENT CHECKLIST

Before any operation, verify:
- [ ] Correct stratos classification determined
- [ ] Appropriate rule files loaded
- [ ] Brain hierarchy respected
- [ ] 0UT reporting configured
- [ ] 1N reception validated
- [ ] Access controls enforced
- [ ] State properly tracked

---

## 🌌 FINAL WORD

> _"This is not just file organization. This is a living, breathing system where every box knows its purpose, every brain knows its domain, and every transmission flows to where it needs to go. From micro-scripts to mega-stations, all connected through unified intelligence."_

**Genesis established. Let the system evolve.**
