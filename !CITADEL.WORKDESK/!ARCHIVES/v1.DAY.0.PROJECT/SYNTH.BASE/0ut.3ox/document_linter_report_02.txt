FORMATTING ISSUES BY DOCUMENT
==============================================

[1] doc1_budget.txt - SEVERITY: MINOR
---------------------------------------------
⚠️ Line 6: "Total Income:" lacks bullet marker (inconsistent)
⚠️ Line 14: "Total Expenses:" lacks bullet marker (inconsistent)
⚠️ Line 16: "Net:" lacks bullet marker (inconsistent)
⚠️ Line 18: "Notes:" section breaks structural pattern
⚠️ Line 20: Trailing empty line

Recommendation: Standardize total/summary line formatting
or establish clear visual hierarchy for calculations vs items.

[2] doc2_notes.txt - SEVERITY: CLEAN
---------------------------------------------
⚠️ Line 20: Trailing empty line

Recommendation: Document is well-structured. Remove trailing
whitespace for consistency.

[3] doc3_contacts.txt - SEVERITY: MAJOR
---------------------------------------------
⚠️ Lines 3-4: VA contacts lack section header/grouping
⚠️ Lines 6-7: Landlord entry structure differs from others
⚠️ Line 10: Inconsistent indentation (should align with line 11)
⚠️ Lines 9-11: Mixed use of colons in subsection headers
⚠️ Lines 17-18: TWO trailing empty lines (excessive)

Recommendation: Establish consistent contact grouping format.
Add "Government Services:" or "VA Resources:" header for lines 3-4.
Standardize indentation. Remove extra whitespace.

[4] doc4_todo.txt - SEVERITY: CLEAN
---------------------------------------------
⚠️ Line 22: Trailing empty line

Recommendation: Excellent priority-based structure. Remove
trailing whitespace only.

[5] doc5_ideas.txt - SEVERITY: MINOR
---------------------------------------------
⚠️ Line 18: "Questions to explore:" uses colon inconsistently
   (other section headers don't use colons)
⚠️ Line 23: Trailing empty line

Recommendation: Standardize section header format across
document (either all with colons or none).

==============================================
CROSS-DOCUMENT PATTERNS
==============================================

PATTERN 1: Trailing Empty Lines
- Found in: ALL 5 documents
- Impact: Inconsistent file endings, wasted space
- Fix: Remove trailing whitespace across collection

PATTERN 2: Section Header Inconsistency
- doc1_budget.txt: "Income:", "Expenses:", "Notes:"
- doc2_notes.txt: "Launch Plan:", "Technical:", "Next Steps:"
- doc3_contacts.txt: Mixed (some with colons, some without)
- doc4_todo.txt: "HIGH PRIORITY:", "COMPLETED:", etc.
- doc5_ideas.txt: Mixed (most without, one with)
- Impact: No established standard across document library
- Fix: Establish style guide (recommend: colons for all sections)

PATTERN 3: Indentation Standards
- Most documents use flat structure with bullets
- doc3_contacts.txt attempts hierarchy but inconsistent
- Impact: Minor, but affects readability in doc3
- Fix: Define indentation rules for nested items
