   - GI Bill chapter and remaining balance
   - Benefit review dates
   - Contact information: [[doc3_contacts.txt]]

2. **Track VA Healthcare Expenses**
   - Copays (even if small)
   - Travel to VA appointments
   - Non-VA emergency care
   - Prescriptions not covered

3. **Link to Support Network**
   - VA Office: 1-800-827-1000 ([[doc3_contacts.txt]])
   - GI Bill Support: 1-888-442-4551
   - Veterans Crisis Line: 988 then 1
   - Combined Arms: (555) 234-5678

4. **Action Item Tracking**
   - "Call VA about benefits" ([[doc4_todo.txt]])

   - Update budget after benefit changes

### Financial Readiness for Transition

**Current Runway**:
- Monthly surplus: $2,560

**Recommendation**:
