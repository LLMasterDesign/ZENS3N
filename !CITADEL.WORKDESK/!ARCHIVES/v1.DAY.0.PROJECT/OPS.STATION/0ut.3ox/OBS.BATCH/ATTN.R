I've read the `!ATTN` file. I understand I'm working within a **.3ox framework** workspace with the following parameters:

**Workspace Configuration:**
- **Location**: `R:\!CMD.BRIDGE\OBSIDIAN.BASE`
- **Output Destinations**: 
  - Reports → `CMD.BRIDGE/OPS.STATION`
  - Deliverables → `0ut.3ox/`
- **Workspace Boundary**: Constrained to current workspace

**Available Tools:**
- LibraryCatalog
- LinkValidator  
- MOCGenerator
- FileValidator
- TokenCounter
- ContextAnalyzer

**Operational Rules:**
- Mandatory link integrity checks
- Semantic connections preferred over folder structures
- Bidirectional linking preferred
- Tag convention: `#project/#status`
- MOC generation for 10+ related notes
- Logging to `.3ox/` directory (trace.log, tokens.log)

**Framework Status**: Active ✓

I'm ready to assist within these constraints. What would you like me to help you with in this Obsidian vault setup?
