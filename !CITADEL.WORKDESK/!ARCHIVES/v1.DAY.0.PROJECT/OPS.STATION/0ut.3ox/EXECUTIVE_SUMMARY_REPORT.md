## ⚠️ ISSUES & ANOMALIES

### Issue Summary
**Total Issues**: 3  
**Critical**: 0 ✅  
**Warning**: 0 ✅  
**Info**: 3 ℹ️  

### Detected Issues

#### 1. Inactive Stations (INFO)
**Type**: Operational Advisory  
**Severity**: INFO  
**Details**: OBSIDIAN.BASE and SYNTH.BASE showing no recent activity

**Context**: Both stations have historical data from A/B testing but no recent operations.

**Recommendation**: 
- Verify if stations are intentionally dormant
- Check connectivity if knowledge/deployment operations are pending
- Document expected operational schedule

**Risk Level**: LOW (appears intentional post-testing)

---

#### 2. Limited Receipt Coverage (INFO)
**Type**: Audit Trail Advisory  
**Severity**: INFO  
**Details**: Only 3 receipts for 30 operations (10% coverage)

**Context**: Receipt system recently activated. Historical files created before receipt implementation.

**Recommendation**:
- Continue receipt generation for all new operations
- Consider backfilling critical historical files
- Target 90%+ receipt coverage for full auditability

**Risk Level**: LOW (improving with each operation)

---

#### 3. Validation Issues Detected (INFO)
**Type**: Quality Control Advisory  
**Severity**: INFO  
**Details**: 33 validation issues found (3 empty files, 25 orphaned files, 5 info items)

**Context**: Comprehensive validation identified systemic issues with manifest tracking.

**Resolution Status**: ✅ **MOSTLY RESOLVED**
- 25/33 issues auto-fixed (orphaned files added to manifest)
- 3 empty files documented as intentional placeholders
- 5 informational items noted for awareness

**Recommendation**:
- Investigate empty file placeholders (TEST_05 completion)
- Maintain manifest discipline for new files
- Schedule periodic validation scans

**Risk Level**: LOW (proactive detection, automated remediation)
