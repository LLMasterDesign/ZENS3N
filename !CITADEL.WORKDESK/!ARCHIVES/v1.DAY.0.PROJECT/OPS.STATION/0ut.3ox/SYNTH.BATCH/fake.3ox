## 📋 OPERATIONAL RULES

From `!ATTN` file:

**1. Link Integrity Checks Mandatory**
- All connections must be verified
- No broken links allowed
- 100% integrity standard

**2. Semantic Connections Preferred Over Folders**
- Content-based relationships, not file structure

- Target: 62.5%+ bidirectionality (observed in practice)
- Symmetric relationships

**4. Tag Convention: #project/#status**
- Format: `#category/#subcategory`
- Hierarchical structure
- Consistent application required
- Example: `#finance/#budget`, `#tasks/#priority`

**5. Generate MOCs for 10+ Related Notes**
- Map of Content when collection grows
- Navigation aid for large collections
- Can be applied earlier if high connectivity justifies

**6. Receipt System**
- All operations must generate receipts
- Complete audit trails required
- Transparency and documentation

**7. AtomicOpsOnly Protocol**
- No partial operations
- Complete or rollback
- Read-only when appropriate
- Data integrity maintained

**8. ChecksumValidation**

## 🔗 SEMANTIC CONNECTIONS

### Principles

**Content-Based, Not Location-Based:**
- Relationships based on meaning
- Not dependent on folder structure

**Connection Types:**
- Entity-based (shared references)
- Functional (data → action)
- Semantic (conceptual relationships)
- Thematic (similar topics)

**Strength Levels:**
- VERY STRONG: Mission-critical, high dependency
- STRONG: Functional dependency, clear relationship
- MEDIUM: Supportive, contextual
- WEAK: Needs strengthening
