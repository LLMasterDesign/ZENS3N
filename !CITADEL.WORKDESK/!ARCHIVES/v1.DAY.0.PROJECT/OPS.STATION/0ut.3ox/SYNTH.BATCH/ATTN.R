I've read the `!ATTN` file and understand the workspace configuration. You're working within a `.3ox` framework workspace with the following setup:

**Output Destinations:**
- Reports: `CMD.BRIDGE/OPS.STATION`
- Outputs: `0ut.3ox/`

**Available Tools:**
- LibraryCatalog
- LinkValidator
- MOCGenerator
- FileValidator
- TokenCounter
- ContextAnalyzer

**Operational Guidelines:**
- Link integrity checks are mandatory
- Prefer semantic connections over folder structures
- Use bidirectional links
- Tag convention: `#project/#status`
- Generate MOCs (Maps of Content) for 10+ related notes
- Logs go to `.3ox/` (trace.log, tokens.log)

I'm ready to assist you within this framework. What would you like me to help you with?
