Perfect! I've analyzed the budget file. Let me verify the calculations:

**Income Verification:**
- VA Disability: $3,200
- GI Bill: $1,800
- **Total Income: $5,000** ✓ (Correct: 3,200 + 1,800 = 5,000)

**Expenses Verification:**
- Rent: $1,500
- Food: $600
- Transportation: $200
- Phone: $80
- Internet: $60
- **Total Expenses: $2,440** ✓ (Correct: 1,500 + 600 + 200 + 80 + 60 = 2,440)

**Net Verification:**
- **Net: $2,560** ✓ (Correct: 5,000 - 2,440 = 2,560)

**✓ RECONCILIATION RESULT: ALL CALCULATIONS ARE CORRECT**
