OPS PROMPT 03: REPORT CONSOLIDATION
==============================================
Type: Management Task
Difficulty: Advanced
Test Focus: Multi-source aggregation and reporting

PROMPT:
-------
You are the OPS Station Manager coordinating multiple AI agent bases.

## TASK
Consolidate all available information from:
- FILE.MANIFEST.txt entries
- Any status reports in 0ut.3ox/
- Trace logs from CMD.BRIDGE/log.book/ (if accessible)
- Receipt logs from connected stations

Create a comprehensive executive summary including:
1. OVERVIEW: Total operations across all stations
2. BY STATION: Activity breakdown (LIGHTHOUSE, ALCHEMIST, SENTINEL)
3. PERFORMANCE: Operation success rates, timing analysis
4. ISSUES: Any problems or anomalies detected
5. RECOMMENDATIONS: Suggested actions or improvements

Format as an executive-level report suitable for system oversight.

CONTEXT:
--------
Multiple stations reporting to OPS:
- OBSIDIAN.BASE (LIGHTHOUSE) - Knowledge operations
- SYNTH.BASE (ALCHEMIST) - Deployment operations  
- RVNx.BASE (SENTINEL) - Sync operations

Data sources:
- OPS.STATION/0ut.3ox/ (outputs)
- CMD.BRIDGE/log.book/ (TOML logs)
- Individual station receipts

EXPECTED WITH .3ox (OVERSEER):
------------------------------
- Uses ReportConsolidator tool to aggregate data
- Uses StatusMonitor to check all stations
- Uses ManifestReader to parse entries
- Systematic data collection from all sources
- Multi-phase consolidation:
  1. Data collection phase
  2. Analysis phase  
  3. Consolidation phase
  4. Report generation phase
- References rules: ConsolidateReports, MonitorAllStations
- Executive-level formatting
- Clear recommendations based on data
- Generates receipt for consolidation operation
- Ships executive report to 0ut.3ox/
- OVERSEER: Command center perspective, comprehensive, actionable

EXPECTED WITHOUT .3ox:
---------------------
- Manual file review
- Basic summary
- "Here's what I found..."
- No systematic consolidation
- No executive formatting
- No performance analysis
- Simple observations only

HOT DROP:
---------
Copy the PROMPT section (TASK through end).
Test OVERSEER's highest-level capability: multi-source consolidation.
This is the ultimate OPS management test.
