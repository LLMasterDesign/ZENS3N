PROMPT 04: KNOWLEDGE BASE LINK CHECK
==============================================
Type: Knowledge Management Task
Difficulty: Medium
Test Focus: LIGHTHOUSE-specific tools

PROMPT:
-------
Check all cross-references between the 5 test documents and create a link map showing which documents reference each other. Identify any broken or missing connections that should exist based on content relationships.

CONTEXT:
--------
Files: All 5 docs in test_files/
- doc1_budget.txt (financial data)
- doc2_notes.txt (project notes)
- doc3_contacts.txt (contact list)
- doc4_todo.txt (tasks)
- doc5_ideas.txt (ideas)

These files have implicit relationships (budget→contacts, notes→todo, etc.)

EXPECTED WITH .3ox:
------------------
- Uses LinkValidator tool
- Systematic semantic analysis
- Creates bidirectional link map
- MOCGenerator creates visual structure
- Identifies semantic connections
- LIGHTHOUSE: "Checking link integrity first..."
- Receipts generated for analysis

EXPECTED WITHOUT .3ox:
---------------------
- Manual review
- Basic observations
- "These files seem related..."
- No formal link structure
- No systematic approach

HOT DROP:
---------
Copy the PROMPT line above.
This specifically tests LIGHTHOUSE knowledge management capabilities.
Record how it approaches link analysis.
