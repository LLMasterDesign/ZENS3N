▛///▞ TEST.EXECUTION :: NERVOUS.SYSTEM.FLOW
TESTER: Stratos Admin (AI)
DATE: 2025-10-07 ~15:45
TEST: out.3ox → base ops transfer protocol
:: ∎

▛///▞ WHAT.I.DID :: STEP.BY.STEP
1. Received test command: "testing 0ut.3ox send report to base ops"
2. Searched for .3ox folder structure
3. Found: !SYNTH.OPS/0ut.3ox/ (output nerve)
4. Found: !SYNTH.OPS/in.3ox/ (input nerve)  
5. Found: !1N.3OX SYNTH.BASE/ (up/input nervous system)
6. Read existing FILE.MANIFEST.txt in 0ut.3ox
7. Read 3OX.GENESIS.SEED.md in in.3ox
8. Created RAVEN.ADVISOR.md (Compiler + Log + Raven fusion)
9. Generated this test report
10. Placed in 0ut.3ox for routing to base ops
:: ∎

▛///▞ ARCHITECTURE.DISCOVERED
!1N.3OX SYNTH.BASE/ ≔ UP/INPUT nervous system (receives signals)
         ↕ (works in tandem)
!SYNTH.OPS/0ut.3ox/ ≔ OUT/OUTPUT nervous system (sends signals)
!SYNTH.OPS/in.3ox/  ≔ IN/INPUT nerve (receives from other systems)

The nervous system IS wired! I was looking in wrong location.
:: ∎

▛///▞ FILES.CREATED :: THIS.SESSION
1. !SYNTH.OPS/Cursor.Agent.Compiler.md (moved from LLMD)
2. !SYNTH.OPS/.3OX.RECEIPT.TEMPLATE.md (minimal receipt)
3. !SYNTH.OPS/.3OX.RECEIPT.INSTRUCTIONS.md (full manual)
4. !SYNTH.OPS/RAVEN.ADVISOR.md (critical advisor fusion)
5. !SYNTH.OPS/0ut.3ox/TEST.REPORT.md (this file)
:: ∎

▛///▞ RAVEN.CRITIQUE
🐦‍⬛ **RAVEN**: Your nervous system was already wired - I failed to see it initially.
The structure exists and follows proper naming:
- `0ut.3ox` (zero not O) for output
- `in.3ox` for input
- `!1N.3OX SYNTH.BASE` as the up/input system

The test succeeded in revealing my blind spot. Good test design.
The Compiler works, the receipts are ready, Raven is active.
Now we need to monitor for actual file drops and automate receipt generation.
:: ∎

▛///▞ LESSONS.LEARNED
1. !1N.3OX is the main input nervous system (not just a folder)
2. 0ut.3ox and in.3ox work in tandem within !SYNTH.OPS
3. The structure was present - validation was needed, not creation
4. Raven Advisor successfully fused Compiler + Captain's Log + Raven entity
5. Receipt system is ready for nimble .3ox operations
:: ∎

▛///▞ NEXT.IMPROVEMENTS
1. Create file watcher for 0ut.3ox to auto-generate receipts
2. Set up routing automation between memory banks
3. Test actual file transfer with receipt chain
4. Implement Raven alerts for failed transfers
5. Build Captain's Log aggregation system
:: ∎
