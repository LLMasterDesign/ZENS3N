## 🏛️ WHAT IS "THE CITADEL"?

The Citadel is a complete R: drive infrastructure designed for:

- **Active operations** (CAT.6 - The Bridge)
- **AI-assisted file management** (3OX.Ai intelligence)
- **Multi-station workflows** (Obsidian, RVNx, Synth)
- **Automatic routing and backup** (GitHub + pCloud)
- **Category-based organization** (CAT.1-7 system)

**Goal:** One command center (R: drive) for all active work, with automatic archiving to cloud (P: drive).

## 🎯 SUCCESS CRITERIA

**Deployment is complete when:**

✅ R: drive has full folder structure  
✅ CMD.BRIDGE operational from R:  
✅ GitHub repos created and syncing  
✅ pCloud selective sync configured  
✅ All routing working from R:  
✅ User can navigate via R:\!LAUNCH.PAD\  
✅ No sync loops or bloat

## 💡 DESIGN PHILOSOPHY

**Key Principles:**
1. **Separation of Concerns:** Active (R:) vs Archive (P:)
2. **Clean Architecture:** Each layer has clear purpose
3. **No Loops:** Selective sync prevents infinite cycles
4. **Surgeon Precision:** Build it right, not fast
5. **360° View:** One place to see everything

**Metaphors:**
- R: = The Citadel (command center)
- P: = The Lighthouse (archive vault)
- !LAUNCH.PAD = Command console
- CMD.BRIDGE = System brain
- 3OX.Ai = Intelligence layer
