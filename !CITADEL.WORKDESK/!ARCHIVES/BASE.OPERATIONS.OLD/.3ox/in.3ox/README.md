## 🔄 Workflow

```
1. Task file drops here
2. AI reads and processes
3. Work happens in BASE.OPERATIONS main area
4. Result goes to 0ut.3ox/
5. Original task file DELETED or moved to archive
```

**Goal:** This folder should be empty after processing.

## 💡 Example

**File:** `create-dashboard.txt`
```
Create status dashboard showing all station activity
```

**AI does:**
1. Reads task
2. Creates dashboard in BASE.OPERATIONS/
3. Outputs result to 0ut.3ox/DASHBOARD.COMPLETE.md
4. Deletes create-dashboard.txt

**Result:** in.3ox is empty again ✓

**Remember:** This is an intake valve that should drain, not a storage location.
