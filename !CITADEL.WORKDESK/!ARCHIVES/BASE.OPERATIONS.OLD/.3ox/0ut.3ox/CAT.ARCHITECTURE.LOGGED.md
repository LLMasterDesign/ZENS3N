## 🗼 The Lighthouse Revelation

**CAT.7 is not just a folder** - it's a "piezoelectric supercharged system"

### Inside The Lighthouse:

**Raven's Citadel:**
- Only truth goes here
- Best sellers perfectly preserved
- Museum-grade collection

**The Golden Pyramid:**
- Lu's pain and torment
- His story, his legacy
- What he'll leave behind
- **Makes the lighthouse shine** (pain → light)

**The Carbon Copy:**
- Reference docs for ops
- Streamline operations
- Working copies

**General Contents:**
- All other lighthouse materials

## ⚡ The Piezoelectric Principle

Like piezoelectric crystals (pressure → electricity):

**In The Lighthouse:**
Pain/Torment (Pyramid) → Light/Legacy (Output)

The Golden Pyramid contains the pressure of Lu's story and transforms it into the light that makes the whole lighthouse shine.

## 💡 What This Means

**This is life architecture** - not just files:
- CAT.0: What we protect
- CAT.1-5: How we live  
- CAT.6: How we coordinate
- CAT.7: What we transcend to

**Like 5D angels or Zero-Two boss from Kirby** - transcendent, next-level folders with symbolic power.
