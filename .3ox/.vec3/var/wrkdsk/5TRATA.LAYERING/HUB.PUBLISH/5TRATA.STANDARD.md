# 5TRATA Standard

Version: 1.0
Status: Active
Date: 2026-02-13

## Purpose
5TRATA defines a stable layering order so large file estates can be organized without structural drift.

## Layer Order
1. CMD
2. Base
3. Station
4. Service
5. Agent
6. Runtime

## Governance Rule
One layer is locked and verified before the next layer is changed.

## Current Program State
- Layers 0-4 are under active lock governance.
- Layer 5 (Runtime) is deferred until earlier layers remain stable.
