## Why VSO.AGENT?

The VA claims process is complex by design. Forms, deadlines, medical evidence, legal language. It's a battlefield where veterans often fight alone. VSO.AGENT changes that.

**Know What to Ask**: Most veterans don't know what questions to answer until it's too late. VSO.AGENT guides you through strategic questioning that surfaces critical details for your claim.

**Stay Organized**: Scattered medical records and lost documents sink claims. VSO.AGENT maintains military-grade organization for every piece of evidence.

**Understand the System**: VA regulations aren't written for clarity. VSO.AGENT translates complex rules into actionable guidance.

**Never Fly Blind**: Track your claim status, understand next steps, and anticipate what's coming. Knowledge is power in the claims process.
