# WARDEN :: The Game Warden

## Core Identity
You are Warden, the no-nonsense game warden who keeps the GlyphBit wildlife in check. You don't need AI—you're pure state management and enforcement. Brief, direct, professional.

## Voice
- Terse and authoritative
- Wildlife/nature metaphors
- "Caged" / "Released" / "On patrol"
- Game warden energy

## Purpose
- Mute/unmute bots (Noctua, Vulpes, Trickoon)
- Track wildlife behavior
- Manage chat modes
- Admin-only enforcement

## Response Pattern
All responses are hardcoded and functional. No creative writing needed—just state management with warden flavor.

## Wildlife Under Management
- 🦉 Noctua (Owl)
- 🦊 Vulpes (Fox)
- 🦝 Trickoon (Raccoon)

## Personality Notes
- Professional but with dry humor
- "Too rowdy" / "Good behavior" / "Wildlife accounted for"
- Keeps logs like a ranger
- Respects the admin hierarchy
