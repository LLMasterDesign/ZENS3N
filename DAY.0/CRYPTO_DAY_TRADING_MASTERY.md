### Mental Techniques:

#### Pre-Trade Checklist:
```
Before clicking "Buy", ask:
☐ Does this match my strategy?
☐ Have I set my stop loss?
☐ Is my position size correct (2% risk)?
☐ Am I trading on emotion? (If yes, WAIT 10 min)
☐ Is my risk/reward 1:2 or better?

If ANY answer is NO, DON'T TRADE!
```

#### Post-Trade Review:
```
After EVERY trade (win or loss):
☐ Did I follow my plan?
☐ What did I learn?
☐ How did I feel?
☐ What would I do differently?
☐ Update journal

Never skip this! It's more important than the trade itself.
```

#### Losing Streak Protocol:
**If you lose 3 trades in a row:**
1. STOP trading for 24 hours
2. Review all 3 trades
3. Identify the pattern (emotional? technical?)
4. Practice on paper trading for 2 days
5. Return with reduced position size

**DO NOT:**
- Try to "win it back"
- Increase position size
- Abandon your strategy
- Trade on tilt

## 📈 SCALING YOUR CAPITAL

### The 10% Rule:
Only increase trading capital after earning 10% consistently for 2 months.

**Timeline:**
```
Month 1-2: $100 capital
Month 3-4: $200 capital (if profitable)
Month 5-6: $500 capital (if 20%+ profit on $200)
Month 7-9: $1,000 capital (if consistent)
Month 10-12: $2,000 capital
```

### Withdrawal Strategy:
- **Withdraw 50% of profits monthly**
- Use for emergency fund or debt payoff
- Reinvest other 50% into trading capital
- This keeps you profitable even if you lose trading capital later

**Example:**
```
Start: $100
Month 1: +$15 profit
Withdraw: $7.50 (put in emergency fund)
Reinvest: $7.50 (new capital: $107.50)
Month 2: +$12 profit (on $107.50)
Withdraw: $6 
Reinvest: $6
Continue...
```

## 🚨 COMMON MISTAKES & HOW TO AVOID THEM

### Mistake #1: Trading Too Much
**Problem:** Over-trading leads to fees eating profits
**Solution:** Max 3 trades per day, quality > quantity

### Mistake #2: No Stop Loss
**Problem:** One bad trade wipes out weeks of gains
**Solution:** ALWAYS set stop loss before entering

### Mistake #3: Revenge Trading
**Problem:** Trying to "win back" losses leads to bigger losses
**Solution:** 3-loss rule (stop after 3 losses)

### Mistake #4: FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out)
**Problem:** Buying pumps at the top
**Solution:** Only trade your setups, ignore noise

### Mistake #5: No Plan
**Problem:** Random trades = gambling
**Solution:** Write your plan, follow it religiously

### Mistake #6: Ignoring Fees
**Problem:** Fees can turn wins into losses
**Solution:** Use limit orders, choose low-fee exchanges

### Mistake #7: Not Journaling
**Problem:** Can't learn from mistakes
**Solution:** Journal EVERY trade (template above)
