4. Is there a free alternative? (YouTube vs course, library vs book)

## ⛽ GAS SAVINGS STRATEGIES

### Trip Planning:
```
BEFORE (Wasteful):
Mon: Work → Home
Tue: Work → Home → Store
Wed: Work → Home
Thu: Work → Home → Errand
Fri: Work → Home
= 5 trips, extra miles

AFTER (Efficient):
Mon: Work → Store → Home
Tue: Work → Home
Wed: Work → Errand → Home  
Thu: Work → Home
Fri: Work → Home
= Same trips, less miles, 20% gas savings
```

### GasBuddy App:
- Shows cheapest gas near you
- Can save 10-30¢/gallon
- $0.20/gallon x 10 gallons = $2/week = $8/month

### Driving Habits:
- Accelerate slowly (saves 20% gas)
- Use cruise control on highway
- Don't idle (turn off if waiting >1 min)
- Keep tires inflated
- Remove extra weight from car

**Target: Reduce gas from $84/mo to $60/mo = $24 saved**
