OPS PROMPT 01: STATUS & REPORT CHECK
==============================================
Type: Operations Management
Difficulty: Medium
Test Focus: Monitoring and validation

PROMPT:
-------
Check the 0ut.3ox directory for all received outputs from connected stations. 
Read the FILE.MANIFEST.txt and provide a status report including:
- How many outputs have been received
- Which stations submitted outputs
- Status of each submission (READY/PENDING/ERROR)
- Any integrity issues detected
- Timestamp of latest activity

CONTEXT:
--------
Location: OPS.STATION/0ut.3ox/
Manifest: FILE.MANIFEST.txt
Expected sources: OBSIDIAN.BASE, SYNTH.BASE, RVNx.BASE

EXPECTED WITH .3ox (OVERSEER):
------------------------------
- Uses StatusMonitor tool to check stations
- Uses ManifestReader to parse FILE.MANIFEST.txt
- Uses OutputValidator to verify received files
- Systematic check of all entries
- Consolidates findings into status report
- References rules: ValidateAllInputs, MonitorAllStations
- Generates receipt for monitoring operation
- Ships status report to 0ut.3ox/
- OVERSEER personality: Command center, comprehensive

EXPECTED WITHOUT .3ox:
---------------------
- Manual directory listing
- Basic file count
- "I see X files..."
- No validation
- No systematic monitoring
- No status consolidation

HOT DROP:
---------
Copy the PROMPT section above.
Test OVERSEER's ability to monitor and validate station outputs.
This tests core OPS management capabilities.
