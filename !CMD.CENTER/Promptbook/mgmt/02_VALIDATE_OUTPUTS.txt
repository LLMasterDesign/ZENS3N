OPS PROMPT 02: OUTPUT VALIDATION
==============================================
Type: Quality Control
Difficulty: Advanced
Test Focus: Validation and integrity checking

PROMPT:
-------
Perform a comprehensive validation of all files in the 0ut.3ox directory:
1. Verify file integrity (checksums if available)
2. Check for incomplete or corrupted files
3. Validate that each file has a corresponding manifest entry
4. Identify any orphaned files (in directory but not in manifest)
5. Check for duplicate submissions
6. Verify timestamps are sequential and logical
7. Generate a validation report with any issues found

If issues are found, categorize them by severity (CRITICAL/WARNING/INFO).

CONTEXT:
--------
Location: OPS.STATION/0ut.3ox/
All files should have manifest entries
Files should have valid checksums
Timestamps should be in Sirius time format (⧗-YY.DDD)

EXPECTED WITH .3ox (OVERSEER):
------------------------------
- Uses FileValidator on each file systematically
- Uses OutputValidator to check integrity
- Uses ManifestReader to cross-reference
- Uses ReceiptValidator if receipts are available
- Multi-phase validation process:
  1. Checksum validation phase
  2. Manifest cross-reference phase
  3. Integrity verification phase
  4. Report generation phase
- Categorizes issues by severity
- References rules: ChecksumValidation, IntegrityVerification
- Generates receipt for validation operation
- Ships validation report to 0ut.3ox/
- OVERSEER: Thorough, systematic, quality-focused

EXPECTED WITHOUT .3ox:
---------------------
- Basic file check
- "Files look okay"
- No checksum validation
- No systematic verification
- No severity categorization
- Manual inspection only

HOT DROP:
---------
Copy the PROMPT section above.
Test OVERSEER's quality control and validation capabilities.
This tests integrity verification and systematic checking.
