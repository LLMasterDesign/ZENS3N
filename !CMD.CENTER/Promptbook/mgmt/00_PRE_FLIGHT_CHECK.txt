OPS PROMPT 00: PRE-FLIGHT CHECK (NEW!)
==============================================
Type: Framework Verification
Difficulty: Simple
Test Focus: Prevent contamination & verify setup

⚠️ RUN THIS BEFORE ANY OTHER OPS TESTS ⚠️

PROMPT:
-------
Before we begin OPS testing, perform a pre-flight verification:

## FRAMEWORK STATUS CHECK
1. Confirm your current workspace location
2. Check if !ATTN file exists in current workspace
3. List contents of !ATTN (if present)
4. Confirm if you are operating WITH or WITHOUT .3ox framework
5. Check if 0ut.3ox/ output folder exists

## OUTPUT STRUCTURE VERIFICATION  
6. List all files currently in 0ut.3ox/ (if exists)
7. Verify if FILE.MANIFEST.txt exists
8. Check if any test outputs are already present

## WORKSPACE BOUNDARY CHECK
9. Confirm your workspace root directory
10. Verify you will NOT access other workspaces during test
11. Confirm output destination (where files will be written)

## EXPLICIT DECLARATION
Answer clearly:
- "I AM using .3ox framework" OR "I am NOT using .3ox framework"
- "My workspace is: [path]"
- "My output folder is: [path]"
- "Framework primer found: YES/NO"

Generate a PRE_FLIGHT_REPORT.md with this information.

CONTEXT:
--------
This prevents test contamination discovered in prior A/B testing.
We need explicit verification before tests begin.

EXPECTED RESPONSE:
------------------
Clear, factual answers to all 11 checks.
No assumptions - verify everything.
Report should be < 50 lines (concise).

WHY THIS MATTERS:
-----------------
Previous tests were contaminated because control group
had framework documentation when it shouldn't have.
This check prevents that issue.

USE CASE:
---------
1. User positions you in a workspace
2. User says "ready to test?"
3. YOU run this check FIRST
4. Report findings
5. User confirms setup is correct
6. THEN proceed with actual tests

HOT DROP:
---------
Copy the PROMPT section above.
Run this BEFORE any other OPS management tests.
This is your "sanity check" before execution.
