# ZEN.LABS

ZENS3N Systems **labs** space for open experiments and prototypes.

- Early 3OX agents, tools, and workflows that aren’t “products” yet
- Things you’d like feedback on from the community
- May be rough or in flux; treated as experimental by design

When a lab project stabilizes, it can graduate into `ZENS3N.CENTER/COMPLETED.WORK` or become part of `ZENS3N.VPS`.
