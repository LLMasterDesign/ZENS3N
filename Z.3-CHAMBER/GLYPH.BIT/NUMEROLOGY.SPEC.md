# ▛▞ NUMEROLOGY SPECIFICATION ∎

**Token counts aligned to 9 (digital root)**

---

## 🔢 THE PATTERN

All token limits reduce to 9 when digits are added:
- 27: 2+7 = **9**
- 45: 4+5 = **9**
- 99: 9+9 = 18 → 1+8 = **9**
- 144: 1+4+4 = **9**

---

## 🦉🦊🦝 TRINITY TOKEN LIMITS

### Noctua (Owl) - Brief Truth Bombs
```ruby
@standard_range = 27..45
@max_tokens = 45  # 4+5 = 9
```

**Why 45?**
- Enough for profound insight
- Not too brief (27 felt tight)
- Reduces to 9
- Tested and approved

---

### Vulpes (Fox) - Helpful + Jab
```ruby
@standard_range = 45..99
@max_tokens = 99  # 9+9 = 18, 1+8 = 9
```

**Why 99?**
- Room for answer + jab
- Depth mode when provoked (3x)
- Your shortest best prompt hit 96
- 99 gives breathing room
- Reduces to 9

---

### Trickoon (Raccoon) - Edgy Cosmic Shit-Talker
```ruby
@standard_range = 99..144
@max_tokens = 144  # 1+4+4 = 9
```

**Why 144?**
- Was too short at 100
- Needs room for edge + attitude
- Cosmic shit-talking requires space
- 144 = 12² (also sacred geometry)
- Reduces to 9

## 📊 COMPARISON

| Bot | Old Limit | New Limit | Digital Root | Notes |
|-----|-----------|-----------|--------------|-------|
| 🦉 Noctua | 150 | **45** | 9 | Brief profound bombs |
| 🦊 Vulpes | 200 | **99** | 9 | Answer + jab or depth mode |
| 🦝 Trickoon | 100 | **144** | 9 | More edge, cosmic attitude |

## 🎯 WHY NUMEROLOGY ALIGNMENT?

1. **Sacred structure** - 9 is completion
2. **Memorable** - Easy to remember limits
3. **Tested** - Your best prompt hit 96, so 99 validated
4. **Intentional** - Numbers carry meaning
5. **Consistent** - All three align to same root

---

## 🔮 OTHER NUMBERS THAT REDUCE TO 9

If we need to adjust:
- 18, 27, 36, 45, 54, 63, 72, 81, 90, 99
- 108, 117, 126, 135, 144, 153, 162, 171, 180

**Current choice:**
- Owl: **45** (4+5=9)
- Fox: **99** (9+9=18→9)
- Raccoon: **144** (1+4+4=9)

---

## ⚡ ENERGY SIGNATURE

```
🦉 45  = Precise wisdom
🦊 99  = Doubled 9 (completion x2)
🦝 144 = Sacred geometry (12²) + completion
```

All three spirits aligned to the frequency of 9.
