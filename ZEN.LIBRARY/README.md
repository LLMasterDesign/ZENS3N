# ZEN.LIBRARY

ZENS3N Systems public **library** for research, specs, and reference material.

- Long‑form design docs and lexicons you’re comfortable sharing
- HOWTOs and guides that support the ecosystem
- Not necessarily “products”, but stable enough for others to read and learn from

Projects that graduate from ZEN.LIBRARY can move into `ZENS3N.CENTER` or `ZENS3N.VPS`.
